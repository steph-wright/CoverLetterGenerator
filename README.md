# CoverLetterGenerator
This is version 1 of an app that automatically generates cover letters! Currently command-line based, the app can take skill names and explanations from the user and persists them to a file, then is able to take a person specification and perform a search to see which skills match the person spec, and output the body of a cover letter. 
I plan to add more features to this app, including a web-based UI, the ability to generate introductions and conclusions, and more!
